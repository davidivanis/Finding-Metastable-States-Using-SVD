# Finding-Metastable-States-Using-SVD

The code and paper in this repository were made as a part of the course on matrix and tensor methods in data analysis.
The work is concerned with the problem of finding metastable states of Markov chains using an SVD approach and based on a number of articles written on the subject. The goal was to implement the methods presented in those articles and compare the results.
The code for the paper was written in MATLAB and Python and the method was applied to real world examples that come from the molecular dynamics.
The method explanation, results and all the accompanying plots are presented in the paper.
